## **üìÇ Dataset Structure: Tailored Data for Targeted Prediction and Therapy**

The project utilizes three distinct datasets, each meticulously structured to address specific aspects of mental health prediction and AI therapy:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Student Mental Health Dataset (`student_mental.csv`): Factors Influencing Student Well-being**

This dataset focuses on factors relevant to student mental health, encompassing:

- **Demographics:** `Gender`, `Age`, `City`
- **Academic Environment:** `Academic Pressure` (Level of academic stress), `CGPA` (Cumulative Grade Point Average), `Study Satisfaction` (Satisfaction with their studies)
- **Lifestyle Habits:** `Sleep Duration` (Hours of sleep per night), `Dietary Habits` (Healthy, Moderate, Unhealthy), `Financial Stress` (Level of financial concern), `Work/Study Hours` (Hours spent on work or study per day)
- **Mental Health Background:** `Family History` (Family history of mental illness - Yes/No), `Suicidal Thoughts` (Ever had suicidal thoughts - Yes/No)
- **Target Variable:** `Depression` (Binary outcome: 0 = No Depression, 1 = Depression)

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Professional Mental Health Dataset (`professional_mental.csv`): Understanding Workplace Mental Health**

This dataset shifts focus to the professional environment, capturing factors impacting mental health in the workplace:

- **Demographics:** `Gender`, `Age`, `City`, `Profession` (Occupation), `Degree` (Highest educational degree)

## **üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Preprocessing: Unveiling Insights and Preparing Data**

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** was crucial in understanding the datasets and identifying key factors influencing mental health. The `EDA_and_feature_engineering.ipynb` notebook details this process, which included:

- **Depression Distribution Analysis:** Examining the prevalence of depression within both student and professional datasets to understand the scope of the issue.
- **Feature Importance Analysis (SHAP Values):** Utilizing SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to determine the most influential features contributing to depression prediction in each dataset. This helped identify key risk factors for students and professionals separately.
- **Data Imbalance Handling:** Addressing potential class imbalance in the depression target variable to ensure robust and unbiased model training.

**Data Preprocessing**, documented in `data_preprocessing.ipynb`, focused on preparing the datasets for machine learning models. Key steps included:

- **Missing Value Imputation:** Strategies to handle incomplete data entries, ensuring no data is lost and models can train effectively.
- **Categorical Encoding (One-Hot Encoding):** Converting categorical features (like Gender, City, Degree, Profession) into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms.
- **Feature Scaling (Standardization):** Standardizing numerical features to have zero mean and unit variance. This is essential for algorithms sensitive to feature scaling, like TabNet and XGBoost, ensuring optimal performance.
- **Preprocessing Pipelines:** Creation of distinct pipelines for professionals (`pipeline_professional.pkl`) and students (`pipeline_student.pkl`). These pipelines encapsulate all preprocessing steps, ensuring consistent data transformation during model training and deployment.
